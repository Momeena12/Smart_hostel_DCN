📘 Project Overview

The Smart Hostel System is a comprehensive network simulation developed using Cisco Packet Tracer. It emulates a modern hostel’s network infrastructure, integrating services such as secure internet access, IP surveillance, inter-room communication, and administrative connectivity. This simulation provides a scalable and secure network design suitable for educational or residential hostel environments.

🧩 Features
	•	Router and Switch Configuration: Proper setup of routers and switches to manage network traffic efficiently.
	•	Multiple VLANs: Isolation of network segments for Admin, Students, and Surveillance to enhance security and traffic management.
	•	DHCP: Automatic IP address assignment to devices within the network.
	•	Static and Dynamic Routing: Implementation of routing protocols like RIP, OSPF, or EIGRP to facilitate communication between different network segments.
	•	Wireless Access Points: Provision of wireless connectivity for students and staff.
	•	Server Setup: Centralized servers providing DNS, DHCP, and web services.
	•	Security Implementations: Access Control Lists (ACLs) to restrict unauthorized access.
	•	Smart Devices Integration: Incorporation of IoT devices such as CCTV cameras and other smart appliances.

 🚀 Getting Started

Requirements
	•	Cisco Packet Tracer: Version 8.0 or above is recommended.

How to Open
	1.	Launch Cisco Packet Tracer.
	2.	Open the file smart_hostel_system.pkt.
	3.	Explore the network topology and configurations. ￼ ￼

🔧 Configuration Highlights

Network Topology
	•	Routers: Configured with appropriate interfaces and routing protocols to manage inter-VLAN communication.
	•	Switches: Set up with VLANs to segregate network traffic.
	•	Access Points: Provide wireless connectivity to end devices.
	•	Servers: Host services like DHCP, DNS, and web applications. ￼

VLAN Configuration
	•	VLAN 10: Admin Department
	•	VLAN 20: Student Rooms
	•	VLAN 30: Surveillance Systems
	•	VLAN 99: Management VLAN ￼ ￼ ￼

IP Addressing Scheme
	•	VLAN 10: 192.168.10.0/24
	•	VLAN 20: 192.168.20.0/24
	•	VLAN 30: 192.168.30.0/24
	•	VLAN 99: 192.168.99.0/24 ￼

Routing Protocols
	•	Dynamic Routing: Implemented using OSPF to facilitate efficient routing between VLANs.

Security Measures
	•	ACLs: Configured to restrict access between VLANs, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected.
	•	Port Security: Implemented on switches to prevent unauthorized devices from connecting to the network.

📡 Use Case
